# pi-session-worktrees

The extension only runs inside pi. Unit tests cover `src/core.ts` and prove nothing
about `src/index.ts` wiring, so test a change to `src/index.ts` in a live pi session
before you push it.

## Commands

- `npm run check` — types and lint.
- `npm test` — unit tests.
- `npm run dev` — run pi with this checkout loaded. Never edits settings.json.

## Rules

- Keep pi imports out of `src/core.ts` so the unit tests stay runnable.
- The registry JSON shape is a public contract for outside tools. Changing a field
  name is a breaking change.
- Never switch branches in this checkout. Create a worktree under `_worktrees/`.
